## Instrução
To convert the LaTeX file to DOCX:  

Compile the LaTeX code into a PDF using a LaTeX editor (e.g., Overleaf) or latexmk.  
Use a tool like pandoc with the command: pandoc -s resume.tex -o resume.docx (ensure LaTeX and Pandoc are installed).  
Alternatively, use an online PDF-to-DOCX converter after generating the PDF.  

# Copilot

I can certainly restructure the LinkedIn profile into a top-down format! However, I can't export the document directly to `.docx`. What I can do is format the profile content in a structured way, making it easy for you to copy and paste into a Word document.

Let me get started on organizing the information for you! Here’s a structured version of the profile:
