The result was a 70% improvement in search performance and a more scalable, maintainable system."  
4. Tell me about a time when you had to learn a new skill or technology quickly to complete a task. How did you approach it?  
"During my time at Provider IT & Business Solutions, I was involved in developing a POC focused on insurance and healthcare. Page 4 To do this effectively, I needed to quickly learn Outsystems, a low-code development platform. I immersed myself in the platform's documentation, took online courses, and built a prototype application to get hands-on experience. I also collaborated with more experienced Outsystems developers to learn best practices and troubleshoot issues. Within a few weeks, I was able to contribute meaningfully to the project, creating accounting, dental scheduling, and human resources systems using Outsystems."  
5. Have you ever led a team? If so, describe your leadership style and a key outcome.

Page 5 My leadership style is collaborative and mentoring-focused. I believe in empowering team members, providing them with the resources and support they need to succeed. I also emphasize clear communication, setting clear expectations, and fostering a culture of continuous learning. A key outcome was improving the knowledge base of the developers team by applying JEE and frameworks training, which led to increased productivity and higher quality code."  
6. Give an example of a time when you managed multiple priorities simultaneously. How did you keep everything on track?  
"At Itaú Unibanco, as a Senior Solution Architect, I was responsible for three large communities simultaneously: Real Estate, Vehicles, and Consortium. Page 3 Each community had its own set of projects, deadlines, and stakeholders. To manage these multiple priorities, I used a combination of techniques: I prioritized tasks based on business impact and deadlines, I delegated tasks effectively, and I used project management tools like Jira and Confluence to track progress. I also held regular meetings with stakeholders to ensure alignment and address any issues proactively. This approach allowed me to successfully manage all three communities and deliver high-quality solutions on time."  
7. Describe a significant mistake you made on the job. How did you handle it, and what did you learn?  
"Early in my career, while working at Toutatis, I underestimated the complexity of integrating a new module into the HR Portal project. Page 6 This led to delays and some rework. I learned the importance of thorough analysis and planning, as well as seeking input from experienced colleagues. I took responsibility for the mistake, communicated the issues transparently to the team, and worked to get the project back on track. This experience taught me the value of humility, collaboration, and continuous improvement."  
8. Can you give an example of how you solved a difficult work-related problem?  
"At OLX Brasil, we faced a performance bottleneck in the GeoImovel application. Page 2 Search queries were slow, impacting user experience. I analyzed the system and identified that the database queries were not optimized for the volume of data. I redesigned the queries, implemented indexing strategies, and optimized the database schema. This resulted in a 70% improvement in search performance, significantly enhancing user experience."  
9. Talk about a time when you disagreed with a manager or colleague. How was it resolved?  
"During my time at Cielo, there was a disagreement about the best approach to implementing a new feature. Page 3 I believed that a microservices architecture would be more scalable and maintainable, while a colleague favored a more traditional monolithic approach. We discussed the pros and cons of each approach, considering factors such as development time, performance, and scalability. Ultimately, we agreed to conduct a proof-of-concept to evaluate the microservices approach. The POC demonstrated the benefits of microservices, and we proceeded with that architecture."  
10. Describe a situation where you had to meet a tight deadline. What was your strategy?  
"When I deployed the corporate website using Wordpress, ELB, and MySQL at OLX Brasil, I had only one week to complete the project. Page 2 I prioritized the most critical tasks, focused on delivering a functional website, and deferred less important features to a later phase. I also worked closely with the team to ensure everyone was aligned and working efficiently. By focusing on the essential elements and working collaboratively, we successfully launched the website on time."  
11. Can you share an experience where you improved a process or increased efficiency in your team/department?  
"At OLX Brasil, I accelerated code development by at least 60% by using metadata concepts and code reuse.
